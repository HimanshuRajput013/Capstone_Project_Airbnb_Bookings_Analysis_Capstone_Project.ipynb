## Introduction to Airbnb
Airbnb is a well-known online marketplace that connects people who want to rent out their homes with those looking for accommodations. Established in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia, and Nathan Blecharczyk, Airbnb has grown to become the leading platform for home-sharing worldwide.

Through Airbnb, hosts can offer their properties—whether homes, apartments, or other spaces—for short-term rentals. Travelers can browse and book these listings, which vary from entire homes to private or shared rooms, accommodating various budgets and preferences. Airbnb is particularly popular among travelers seeking to experience destinations from a local’s perspective rather than as typical tourists. Currently, Airbnb boasts over four million listings in more than 100,000 cities.
